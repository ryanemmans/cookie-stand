# **LAB - Cookie Stand**

## ***Problem Domain***

Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. Pat needs help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company.

Salmon Cookies needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location:

- The minimum number of customers per hour.
- The maximum number of customers per hour.
- The average number of cookies purchased per customer.

Pat will need to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, to easily modify input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application.

In addition to building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each location, you also need to create a public-facing page that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, and informative.
